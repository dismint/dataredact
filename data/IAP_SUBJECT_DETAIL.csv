Examples are drawn from real missions including geosynchronous communications satellites during mission and transfer orbits.&#160; Other examples, including GPS IIR, GGS Polar, Indostar-1, and TDRS H, I, J are used to illustrate the topics. The material is applicable to all spacecraft including low earth, geosynchronous, landers and deep space.The course expands on the material in 16.851, providing additional depth and breadth. Of all of spacecraft subsystems, ACS requires the most systems knowledge as pointing effects in all other subsystems.&#160; ACS is also influenced by all other subsystems.</p> <p>The course provides examples for which the frequency domain methods (SISO) covered in 16.06 can be applied. Actual control examples are SISO but students are introduced to methods for 3-axis and maneuvering control using SISO methods. Torque distribution using both thrusters and momentum exchange devices. Momentum unloading is also covered.&#160; We'll discuss dynamics and kinematics covered in 16.07, focusing on practical spacecraft problems. MATLAB software is provided to assist the students in studying the material and doing the problem sets. Grading&#160; (P/D/F) will be based on completing the problem sets and the laboratory experiments. Optional special lectures will cover specialized topics by leading engineers in the field.</p>","2021JA","No advance sign-up",,"Participants must attend all sessions","16.002, 16.06, 16.07 would be helpful.

Given the time limitation of this course, we will restrict our attention to Pr&#127;ufer domains (integral domains where every nonzero finitely generated ideal is invertible), which are classical commutative rings that generalize Dedekind domains and, therefore, rings of algebraic integers. However, we will discuss the connection of ideal theory with valuation theory and factorization theory.

In this 7-week course, we explore the important role the mind plays in losing weight and how mindfulness (the ability to sustain present moment awareness, without judgment) and health coaching strategies (understanding why losing weight is deeply important to you) are the foundation for lasting change. Instructor Ashley Norwood uses her unique blend of training and experience to guide you through a journey of self discovery in relationship to food.<br /><br />The program includes guided instruction in mindfulness meditation practices, group dialogue and weekly home assignments.<br /><br />This class will be taught via Zoom.

Change Ringing is an art-form going back to the 15th century which involves teams of ringers working together to ring bells in weaving patterns that never repeat themselves, algorithmically generating musical permutations.

Each one-hour session is devoted to a poet or two, often a single poem, chosen by session leaders who volunteer to facilitate conversation for that day. Discussion and collaborative close reading are the aim and ideal of each hour. Some participants attend every session, but many others may drop in only once or twice during the series to discuss a favorite poet or poem. The roster of poets is typically diverse: from ancient Chinese masters to American poets laureate, and from such greats as Shakespeare, Keats, Auden, and Bishop to contemporary poets including&#160;Eve L. Ewing, Alice Notley, and many more.

In this 7-week course, we explore the important role the mind plays in losing weight and how mindfulness (the ability to sustain present moment awareness, without judgment) and health coaching strategies (understanding why losing weight is deeply important to you) are the foundation for lasting change. Instructor Ashley Norwood uses her unique blend of training and experience to guide you through a journey of self discovery in relationship to food.<br /><br />The program includes guided instruction in mindfulness meditation practices, group dialogue and weekly home assignments.<br /><br />This class will be taught via Zoom. You will receive a confirmation email once you've paid for the class. Shortly before the first class, you will receive another email with the Zoom link.

Examples are drawn from real missions including geosynchronous communications satellites during mission and transfer orbits.&#160; Other examples, including GPS IIR, GGS Polar, Indostar-1, and TDRS H, I, J are used to illustrate the topics. The material is applicable to all spacecraft including low earth, geosynchronous, landers and deep space.The course expands on the material in 16.851, providing additional depth and breadth. Of all of spacecraft subsystems, ACS requires the most systems knowledge as pointing effects in all other subsystems.&#160; ACS is also influenced by all other subsystems.</p> <p>The course provides examples for which the frequency domain methods (SISO) covered in 16.06 can be applied. Actual control examples are SISO but students are introduced to methods for 3-axis and maneuvering control using SISO methods. Torque distribution using both thrusters and momentum exchange devices. Momentum unloading is also covered.&#160; We'll discuss dynamics and kinematics covered in 16.07, focusing on practical spacecraft problems. MATLAB software is provided to assist the students in studying the material and doing the problem sets. Grading&#160; (P/D/F) will be based on completing the problem sets and the laboratory experiments. Optional special lectures will cover specialized topics by leading engineers in the field.</p>","2021JA","No advance sign-up",,"Participants must attend all sessions","16.002, 16.06, 16.07 would be helpful.

We discuss what recent developments in patent law mean for inventors, and draw examples ranging from the computer software to the pharmaceutical industries.</p> <p>&#160;</p> <p>Please register in advance to receive the webinar Zoom link:&#160;<a href=""https://forms.gle/p3KTSrQF1b8whqpf7"" target=""_blank"">https://forms.gle/p3KTSrQF1b8whqpf7</a></p>","2021JA","Advance sign-up required",,"Participants welcome at individual sessions","None",,"",,13-JAN-21,14-JAN-21,"Y","N",28-OCT-24
